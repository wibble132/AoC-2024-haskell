Advent of code 2024 solutions, written in Haskell.

I haven't used Haskell since doing this last year, but I'm not doing anything too complicated here :)

To run this code, install Haskell (see the getting started page (here)[https://www.haskell.org/get-started/]) or you can run things online with the Haskell playground (here)[https://play.haskell.org/].

A day's inputs should be put into `/app/data/dayN.txt`, replacing N with the day's number (e.g. `day1.txt`, `day22.txt`). The day that is run is set in `app/Main.hs` in the `main` function.
